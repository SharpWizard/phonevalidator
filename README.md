# Phone Validation API Example

This is a simple C# project that demonstrates how to use the Phone Validation API to validate a phone number and email address. It makes an HTTP request to the API endpoint and processes the response.

Please note that before using this API, you need to sign up on the main website and provide your email address.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework or .NET Core installed on your machine
- Visual Studio or any other C# IDE

## Getting Started

1. Sign up on the [Phone Validation API website](https://phonevalidator.xyz) using your email address.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
4. Replace the placeholders in the code (`'xxxxxxxxxx'` and `'xxx@x.com'`) with the actual phone number and email address you want to validate.
5. Build and run the project.

## Usage

When you run the project, it will make an HTTP request to the Phone Validation API with the provided phone number and email address. The API will validate the input and return a response.

The response from the API will be printed to the console. You can modify the code in the `Main` method of the `Program` class to process the response in any way you need.

Please note that this API returns the response in JSON format, making it compatible with any programming language that supports HTTP requests and JSON parsing.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the project or making the HTTP request, make sure you have a stable internet connection. Additionally, double-check that the provided phone number and email address are correct.

If the API endpoint or its response format has changed, you may need to update the code accordingly.

Feel free to use and modify the code as per your requirements.
